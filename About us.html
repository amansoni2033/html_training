    <h1 style="color:palevioletred ;">About Corporate World</h1>

    <p style="color: gray;">The corporate world, at least what I’ve seen of it in India, is a funny thing. It is culturally tailor-made for extroverts, but you still need to get a lot of work done which isn’t possible if you’re very involved in chatter (even if it isn’t idle). One of the biggest lessons you can learn is how to mix the two and add value as an introvert.
         As an introvert, you can go very long without talking to anyone. There are weeks when I just showed up, finished and left, especially at the start of my career. This is all time you can spend getting stuff done. That WILL be noticed and appreciated. However, as you go higher up the chain, your value needs to be more than just executing tasks well - you need to ‘network’ and ‘lead’ (This involves managing up, down and sideways). This is where things get tricky for an introvert.
         Networking. Being at the centre of the web is not optimal, and it’s cognitively taxing for an introvert. Instead, I get to know two or three well-connected people. This is easy - usually, they find you. If I need something, they can put me in touch. As Justin Hibbard pointed out in his answer, “A few deep relationships are better than several shallow ones”.
        Taking credit. There are a few companies where the culture is one of giving credit where it’s due, and nothing feels as good as people speaking for you. In a lot of places, though, introverts can have their thunder stolen after doing the hard yards. This is easy to avoid - It really doesn’t take much to send an email marking your manager, letting them know what you’ve been up to and the impact it made.
        Setting expectations. There are some practices that introverts would do well to follow, and request others to comply. The topmost is letting people know what to expect from you at work. Examples:
        I need meetings to be set up well in advance, so I am aware of the context and walk in prepared to make it as quick and effective as possible. There is hardly anything that can’t wait a couple of hours. If you drag me into a corner and request solutions extempore, you are guaranteed to get well below my 100% - I haven’t had time to reflect and think.
        I detest “instant brainstorming” of the type where you just get people in a room and tell them to throw around ideas for something. I usually tell people the problem, tell them to think of ideas on their own and spend 10–15 minutes at a later time piecing together a final solution. This also happens to be the best way to get an introvert’s contribution.
        If anything’s bothering me, I let my immediate superiors know. This is part of #2, and is also quite handy if I don’t know the solution - it’s more efficient then to get a more experienced colleague’s advice. </p>
